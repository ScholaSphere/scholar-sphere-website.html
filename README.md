             <p>1. Low Level of Economic Development:
            Indiaâ€™s economy was primarily agrarian with about 85% of the population dependent on agriculture.
            The industrial sector was underdeveloped, and the country was a supplier of raw materials to British industries.
            </p>

            <p>2. Agricultural Sector:
           The sector experienced stagnation and deterioration due to exploitative land revenue systems like the Zamindari system.
           There was a lack of investment in technology, irrigation, and fertilizers.
            </p>

            <p>3. Industrial Sector:
            The British policies led to the deindustrialization of India, making it a market for British goods.
            Traditional handicraft industries declined, and modern industries were slow to develop
            </p>

            <p>4.Foreign Trade:
                India became an exporter of primary goods and an importer of finished goods.
                The trade policies were designed to serve British interests

            </p>

            <p>5. Demographic Condition:
                High birth and death rates, resulting in a stagnant population growth.
                Low life expectancy and high infant mortality rates

            </p>

            <p>6. Infrastructure:
                Basic infrastructure like railways, ports, and telecommunication was developed primarily to serve colonial interests.
                There was a lack of proper health and educational facilities
